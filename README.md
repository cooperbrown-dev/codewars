This repository includes my daily codewars challenges, which I am using to help reinforce my learning of JavaScript.

I am attempting to solve at least one problem daily too reinforce my learning. I'm excited to climb the kyu ladder!

I'm also using Git/Gitbash to upload these challenges to get some practice with those as well.
